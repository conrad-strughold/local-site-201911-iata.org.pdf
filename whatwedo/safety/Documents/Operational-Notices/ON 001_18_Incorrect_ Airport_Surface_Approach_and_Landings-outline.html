<li><a href="ON 001_18_Incorrect_ Airport_Surface_Approach_and_Landings-1.html">Background</a></li>
<li><a href="ON 001_18_Incorrect_ Airport_Surface_Approach_and_Landings-1.html">A review of data from various publicly available sources shows a potential increasing operational trend of approaches lined up with an incorrect surface, meaning an incorrect runway or a taxiway. Based on this information, IATA has explored the issue ...</a></li>
<li><a href="ON 001_18_Incorrect_ Airport_Surface_Approach_and_Landings-1.html">It should be noted that, although the attention on these events is often focused on specific operations, in most cases, deeper analysis shows that there can be latent conditions leading to the events. For this reason IATA is working with stakeholders ...</a></li>
<li><a href="ON 001_18_Incorrect_ Airport_Surface_Approach_and_Landings-1.html">Some leading organizations have also identified the same trend and have already taken practical steps to raise awareness on the issue.</a></li>
<li><a href="ON 001_18_Incorrect_ Airport_Surface_Approach_and_Landings-1.html">Available Information Resources and Operational Recommendations</a></li>
<li><a href="ON 001_18_Incorrect_ Airport_Surface_Approach_and_Landings-1.html">On 2nd October 2017 the United States Federal Aviation Administration Safety Team (FAAST) &#160;published a notice advising of an increase in “Wrong Surface Landing Incidents” in the National Airspace System (NAS). In response to this risk the FAA has also...</a></li>
<li><a href="ON 001_18_Incorrect_ Airport_Surface_Approach_and_Landings-1.html">This is not a new issue as the taxiway landings investigated by the UK AAIB at London Gatwick by a BAC 1-11 in 1988 and a B737 in 1993 indicate. As this type of event appears to be occurring more frequently in our aviation system, IATA would like to b...</a></li>
<li><a href="ON 001_18_Incorrect_ Airport_Surface_Approach_and_Landings-1.html">Operators should consider the recommendations in the FAA SAFO 17010 and the EASA SIB 2018-06 and evaluate these through their SMS processes to mitigate their specific identified operational risk to a level that is as low as reasonably practical.</a></li>
<li><a href="ON 001_18_Incorrect_ Airport_Surface_Approach_and_Landings-2.html">Operators are also reminded that:</a></li>
<li><a href="ON 001_18_Incorrect_ Airport_Surface_Approach_and_Landings-2.html">Acceptance of a visual approach transfers responsibility to the flight crew for safe navigation to the completion of the flight..</a></li>
<li><a href="ON 001_18_Incorrect_ Airport_Surface_Approach_and_Landings-2.html">Analysis of accident data indicates a strong correlation between the absence of precision approach aids and approach and landing accidents.</a></li>
<li><a href="ON 001_18_Incorrect_ Airport_Surface_Approach_and_Landings-2.html">Analysis of events also suggests that under certain conditions there may be an increased risk of a wrong surface landing incident, such as &#160;at night, or in low visibility conditions.</a></li>
<li><a href="ON 001_18_Incorrect_ Airport_Surface_Approach_and_Landings-2.html">High levels of situational awareness and flight crew RTF discipline are essential during these scenarios. Therefore, additional factors should be considered, such as approaches conducted during the flight crew Window of Circadian Low should be identif...</a></li>
<li><a href="ON 001_18_Incorrect_ Airport_Surface_Approach_and_Landings-2.html">Another factor in these events is expectation bias, for example, where the flight crew expect to see a certain configuration on approach, but the actual configuration is different from what they are used to seeing. It is therefore critical that the li...</a></li>
<li><a href="ON 001_18_Incorrect_ Airport_Surface_Approach_and_Landings-2.html">Operators should identify those airports where the risk of such events may be elevated by design, signage, lighting, construction work in progress and including, but not limited to those airports with closely-spaced parallel runways and taxiways. Flig...</a></li>
<li><a href="ON 001_18_Incorrect_ Airport_Surface_Approach_and_Landings-2.html">Strong consideration should also be given to refusing a late, unexpected, side step to a parallel runway where it significantly increases crew workload at a critical phase of flight and is determined by the flight crew to reduce safety margins</a></li>
<li><a href="ON 001_18_Incorrect_ Airport_Surface_Approach_and_Landings-2.html">Rigorous application of Standard Operating Procedures, including a thorough approach briefing on the expected runway and visual cues, application of Crew Resource Management principles and a high standard of communication between pilot flying and pilo...</a></li>

<li><a href="ON 001_18_Incorrect_ Airport_Surface_Approach_and_Landings-2.html">Conclusion</a></li>
<li><a href="ON 001_18_Incorrect_ Airport_Surface_Approach_and_Landings-2.html">This information is provided to enhance safety awareness, promote safe operations and prevent lining up with, or landing on, an incorrect surface. Members are requested to encourage flight crews to continue reporting safety events and any issues which...</a></li>
