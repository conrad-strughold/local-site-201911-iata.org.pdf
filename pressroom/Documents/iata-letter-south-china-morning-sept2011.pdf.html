<p style="position:absolute;top:149px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft12">&#160;<br/>As we approach 2012 the attention of&#160;the aviation world is focused on Europe with its&#160;<br/>misguided plans to bring&#160;international aviation into&#160;its emissions trading scheme (ETS).&#160;<br/>It is a $1.2 billion mistake that neither&#160;the industry nor the environment can afford.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Aviation is committed to&#160;environmental responsibility. Alongside safety and security, it&#160;is&#160;<br/>a top priority. In 2009 the&#160;aviation value chain agreed to the most ambitious targets of&#160;<br/>any global industry— improving fuel efficiency by 1.5% annually to 2020, capping net&#160;<br/>emissions from 2020 and cutting net&#160;emissions in half by 2050 compared to 2005. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>These targets are challenging. Aviation represents 2% of manmade CO2.&#160;This year&#160;<br/>airlines will&#160;emit about 650 million tonnes of carbon while safely carrying 2.8 billion&#160;<br/>passengers&#160;and 46 million tonnes of&#160;freight. This activity supports 33 million jobs and&#160;<br/>facilitates&#160;$3.5 trillion of&#160;global business. By 2050, we estimate that the&#160;global economy&#160;<br/>will require&#160;air transport&#160;to handle 16&#160;billion passengers and&#160;400 million&#160;tonnes of cargo.&#160;<br/>We aspire to&#160;do that while cutting&#160;our carbon footprint in half to some 320 million tonnes.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Green business is good&#160;business. Fuel savings,&#160;which go hand in hand&#160;with emissions&#160;<br/>reductions,&#160;are business critical. Aviation’s 2012&#160;fuel bill&#160;is expected to top $200 billion.&#160;<br/>Saving even&#160;1% reduces costs by $2&#160;billion. That&#160;is considerable motivation given the&#160;<br/>$4.9 billion&#160;profit forecast for a paltry margin of just 0.8%.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Aviation has a clear plan. The industry has agreed—and the International&#160;Civil Aviation&#160;<br/>Organization&#160;(ICAO) has endorsed—a four pillar strategy based on improved&#160;<br/>technology, efficient&#160;infrastructure, better operations and positive economic measures.&#160;<br/>This is a&#160;global approach by a global industry&#160;to&#160;solve a global problem. A fair and global&#160;<br/>emissions trading or compensation scheme under&#160;the leadership of ICAO could play an&#160;<br/>important role.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Europe’s ETS plans do not measure-up. There is&#160;no requirement for any of the monies&#160;<br/>collected&#160;to&#160;be invested in environmental initiatives. And the&#160;regional approach distorts&#160;<br/>markets. A non-stop flight from Hong&#160;Kong to London would pay ETS costs for its entire&#160;<br/>journey. But changing planes in Moscow, Dubai or Istanbul&#160;means ETS&#160;costs only apply&#160;<br/>to the last leg of the journey.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But the show-stopper could be that&#160;many states view this extra-territorial action as an&#160;<br/>attack on sovereignty that contravenes international law. The&#160;colonial days when Europe&#160;<br/>imposed taxes outside&#160;its border are&#160;over. China, India and the US are among the states&#160;<br/>speaking out. Moreover&#160;the US is processing&#160;a&#160;bill to make it&#160;illegal for its carriers to&#160;<br/>participate&#160;in the scheme.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Kudos goes&#160;to Europe for raising environmental awareness. But the relentless&#160;<br/>determination to implement a flawed regional ETS is dividing&#160;the world just when we&#160;<br/>need unity. It’s time for Europe to focus on a Plan&#160;B that supports ICAO’s commitment&#160;to&#160;<br/>develop a global framework for economic measures by 2013, the principles for which&#160;are&#160;<br/>already agreed. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>While the ETS debate is grabbing headlines, it is important to keep the big picture in&#160;<br/>mind. Aviation’s long-term&#160;vision is to reduce emissions, not&#160;pay for emissions trading&#160;</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:111px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft22">permits. Economic measures are a&#160;medium&#160;term tool until technology, operations and&#160;<br/>infrastructure&#160;solutions&#160;are fully developed. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Governments share responsibility for success on&#160;all four pillars of our strategy. And with&#160;<br/>respect to economic measures, Airlines should&#160;not pay for emissions that&#160;could have&#160;<br/>been avoided with government policies supporting&#160;more efficient infrastructure and low-<br/>carbon technology.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Hong Kong is home to one example.&#160;It is well&#160;known that the crowded airspace in the&#160;<br/>Pearl River&#160;Delta could&#160;be managed better to save emissions, time and costs. The&#160;<br/>solution—which is progressing—can&#160;only be achieved by governments&#160;working together.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We are thinking even bigger. Asia-Pacific&#160;is already the biggest aviation&#160;market in the&#160;<br/>world and growing fast.&#160;To keep pace, the region’s air traffic&#160;management system will&#160;<br/>come under increasing pressure. Europe divides&#160;management of its airspace among&#160;<br/>more than 30 air traffic&#160;control fiefdoms. Quite frankly it’s a&#160;mess that costs the&#160;<br/>environment over 16 million tonnes of&#160;CO2 annually. Europe is now struggling to deliver&#160;<br/>a decade’s&#160;delayed Single European Sky project to rectify the system.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Asia should&#160;not repeat the same mistakes. The&#160;solution is a&#160;Seamless Asian Sky that&#160;<br/>will accommodate growth with a regional approach to air traffic management. And the&#160;<br/>time to act is now—before the problem becomes&#160;critical.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But the biggest advances on environment will be in technology. Airlines are investing&#160;<br/>$1.3 trillion&#160;in&#160;new aircraft that will bring generational fuel efficiency improvements of 15&#160;<br/>to 20%. But even more promising is the potential&#160;for sustainable biofuels.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>These will be&#160;a game changer. Over&#160;their lifecycle, sustainable biofuels from crops such&#160;<br/>as camelina,&#160;jatropha and algae could reduce our carbon footprint by up to 80%.&#160;<br/>Already, through the work of airlines, manufacturers and some entrepreneurial&#160;<br/>businesses,&#160;biofuels have carried commercial passengers on&#160;at least six airlines. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Two major hurdles stand&#160;in our way of achieving&#160;commercialization at&#160;competitive&#160;<br/>prices. First,&#160;big oil needs to invest.&#160;And second,&#160;governments must develop positive&#160;<br/>economic measures to facilitate&#160;the&#160;fiscal and legal frameworks for their&#160;success. The&#160;<br/>benefits go&#160;well beyond aviation. Sustainable biofuels could&#160;provide enormous economic&#160;<br/>opportunities&#160;even in the most desolate of terrains or harshest of climates. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>China is moving in the right direction.&#160;Air China, Boeing and Petro China are working&#160;<br/>together on&#160;a bio-fuels program. Their combined resources make this a&#160;significant&#160;step&#160;<br/>forward and potentially a&#160;model of cooperation for others to follow. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Airline leaders are meeting today in Hong Kong at the Greener Skies conference to&#160;<br/>discuss the&#160;way forward.&#160;It will surely&#160;send a strong message to Europe on the folly of its&#160;<br/>ETS plans. But the even more important outcome will be furthering the understanding&#160;by&#160;<br/>governments of the need for strategic decisions to&#160;support the growth of green&#160;<br/>economies that build on&#160;aviation’s ambitious commitments.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Tony Tyler&#160;<br/>Director General and CEO&#160;<br/>International Air Transport Association</p>
