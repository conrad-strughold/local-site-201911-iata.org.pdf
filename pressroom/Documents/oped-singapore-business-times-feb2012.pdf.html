<p style="position:absolute;top:314px;left:233px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft11"><b>Open letter&#160;by&#160;Tony&#160;Tyler, IATA’s&#160;Director General &amp; CEO&#160;</b></p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:333px;left:203px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft11"><b>Published in the Singapore Business Times, on 13 February&#160;2012&#160;</b></p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:351px;left:108px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft12">&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The focus of&#160;the global aviation industry will be on Singapore this week. It is&#160;a time of great&#160;<br/>uncertainty. IATA’s outlook is for anemic industry profitability.&#160;At best we expect the year to&#160;<br/>bring a 0.6%&#160;profit margin. That is&#160;$3.5 billion&#160;shared across an industry that generates over&#160;<br/>$600 billion&#160;in&#160;revenue. Even that small profit is dependent&#160;upon Europe finding a durable&#160;<br/>solution to&#160;its sovereign&#160;debt crisis.&#160;Should that&#160;not happen&#160;and the continent falls into&#160;<br/>recession,&#160;the airline industry could&#160;see its biggest losses since 2008.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>It is also a time of great contrasts. Despite the economic malaise, people&#160;are still&#160;flying—and&#160;<br/>doing so in&#160;increasing numbers. Passenger demand&#160;grew&#160;6% in 2011&#160;over previous&#160;year levels.&#160;<br/>For some airlines, that translated into&#160;profits. For others, demand increases were still not&#160;<br/>enough to keep revenues ahead of costs. And the recent bankruptcies&#160;of&#160;Malev and Spanair&#160;<br/>show just how difficult the situation&#160;is for some airlines—particularly in Europe.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Asia-Pacific&#160;is the focus&#160;for growth. In 2010, about a third of&#160;all passengers travelled on routes&#160;<br/>to, from or within Asia-Pacific. That&#160;was relatively balanced with the size&#160;of North American and&#160;<br/>European markets. But look ahead just to 2015&#160;and it is&#160;clear that the industry’s center of gravity&#160;<br/>is shifting eastward. By then, routes&#160;associated&#160;with Asia-Pacific are expected to account for&#160;<br/>37% of all passengers,&#160;ahead of the&#160;29% associated with both Europe and North America.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Why the difference in prospects? To&#160;start, China&#160;is an engine&#160;of growth propelling Asia-Pacific&#160;<br/>forward. But the region is also home&#160;to many enlightened policy-makers who understand the&#160;<br/>importance of a successful aviation sector to the&#160;growth of their economies. Singapore is a good&#160;<br/>example, with&#160;policies that have served to facilitate both world-class&#160;infrastructure and airlines.&#160;<br/>The impact is 119,000 jobs and a 5.4%&#160;contribution to Singapore’s GDP.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Not all governments have the same success at capturing aviation’s economic benefits. India, for&#160;<br/>example is crippling the&#160;potential of its industry with bureaucracy, high taxes and inadequate&#160;<br/>infrastructure. The latest&#160;blow is the&#160;proposal to increase Delhi Airport’s charges by 340%. If&#160;<br/>applied, such an increase would make Delhi one&#160;of the most expensive airports in the&#160;world—<br/>destroying the competitiveness of recent investments that created the first possibility for an&#160;<br/>Indian hub airport. And this comes on&#160;top of a disadvantageous tax regime. For example, fuel&#160;<br/>taxes help to increase Indian carriers’ fuel bills to&#160;as much as 45% of their total costs – well&#160;<br/>above a global average of around 30%. &#160;If we resolve these issues, the potential of Indian&#160;<br/>aviation would be much greater than its current 1.7 million jobs&#160;and 0.5%&#160;contribution&#160;to GDP.&#160;<br/>&#160;</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:111px;left:108px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft21">In the face of&#160;such uncertainty and contrasts, airlines are managing their&#160;businesses&#160;very&#160;<br/>tightly. The near-term focus is on&#160;conserving cash, controlling costs, and matching capacity to&#160;<br/>demand. Of&#160;course, we&#160;will be expecting our business partners to do the&#160;same.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Nevertheless, this urgent short-term action should not come at the expense of a long-term&#160;<br/>vision and leadership. In&#160;2011, 2.8 billion people flew and 31 million metric tons of cargo was&#160;<br/>transported internationally&#160;by air. In five years we&#160;expect these numbers to grow by 700 million&#160;<br/>people and&#160;6 million metric tons of&#160;cargo. The connectivity that this implies will drive&#160;global&#160;<br/>growth—carrying people to business, travelers to leisure destinations and&#160;products to&#160;markets.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>A safe, secure, efficient&#160;and sustainable aviation&#160;sector generates wealth—material and of the&#160;<br/>human spirit. To ensure&#160;this vital role, coordination among industry stakeholders and&#160;<br/>government&#160;is critical. That is the focus of the dialogue at the&#160;Singapore Airshow Aviation&#160;<br/>Leadership&#160;Summit today. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;</p>
