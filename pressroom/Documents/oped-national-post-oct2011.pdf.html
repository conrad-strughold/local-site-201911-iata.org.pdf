<p style="position:absolute;top:332px;left:108px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft14">&#160;<br/>Connectivity drives success in our globalized&#160;world. Nothing&#160;physically connects people and&#160;<br/>global business better than airlines.&#160;Worldwide, the air transport industry supports $3.5 trillion&#160;in&#160;<br/>business and transports&#160;35% of the value of goods traded internationally.&#160;Doing this creates at&#160;<br/>least 33 million jobs.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>What is true&#160;for the world is true for&#160;Canada.&#160;According to a&#160;new study by Oxford Economics,&#160;<br/>aviation contributes $33.3 billion to&#160;the country’s GDP and supports 401,000 jobs—good jobs.&#160;<br/>Aviation pays taxes too—over $5.4&#160;billion a year—including&#160;$4.4 billion&#160;paid by aviation firms&#160;<br/>and their employees. Canada’s airlines carry 52 million people and 556,000 tonnes of&#160;air freight&#160;<br/>a year.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>These numbers are impressive. But I believe that air transport could do much more for the&#160;<br/>Canadian economy. Unfortunately, aviation’s well-being, and therefore its ability to continue to&#160;<br/>contribute to&#160;Canada’s economic health, is at risk. Among the biggest challenges is the lack of a&#160;<br/>consistent national aviation policy that values the importance of the sector to the country’s&#160;<br/>vitality. Instead, Canada’s air transport and tourism sectors labor under heavy taxes and fees&#160;<br/>that weaken their competitiveness and limit their&#160;ability to create jobs and&#160;drive prosperity.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>In particular,&#160;many&#160;Canadian airports suffer from&#160;very high fixed costs owing to the country’s&#160;<br/>policy of charging airports&#160;annual rent&#160;for the land&#160;they occupy. Crown&#160;Rent, as it is known, is a&#160;<br/>uniquely Canadian concept that tilts&#160;the playing field of North&#160;American aviation. In 2010 the&#160;<br/>size of the&#160;competitive disadvantage was estimated at $250&#160;million. Making matters worse, the&#160;<br/>rent rises with revenue. This de-incentivizes airports from generating more commercial income&#160;<br/>to offset the&#160;cost burden.&#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Crown rent is not the only issue. Stiff&#160;passenger&#160;security fees, sales taxes on domestic and&#160;<br/>transborder&#160;travel and fuel taxes on international&#160;flights in&#160;some provinces also take their toll on&#160;<br/>competitiveness. According to the&#160;World Economic Forum,&#160;Canada is ranked 125 out of 139&#160;<br/>countries in&#160;the specific index of ticket taxes and airport charges.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Not surprisingly, people are seeking&#160;lower cost&#160;options. Many Canadians choose to&#160;start their&#160;<br/>transborder&#160;and international travel from nearby&#160;US airports. And tourists&#160;are finding&#160;<br/>destinations&#160;that can give better value for money—Canada’s attractiveness as a tourism&#160;<br/>destination&#160;is in decline.&#160;Since 2002 it has dropped from the eighth most visited country&#160;in the&#160;<br/>world to the fifteenth. Each visitor that did not come to Canada and every journey started in the&#160;<br/>US has an economic cost in lost opportunities for&#160;both jobs and business.&#160;<br/>&#160;</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:111px;left:108px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft22">Today leaders from the public and private sectors are gathering in Ottawa at the International&#160;<br/>Air Transport Association’s (IATA) first Aviation Day Canada. Among the&#160;topics on the agenda&#160;<br/>is government’s role in&#160;facilitating sustainable growth for the airline industry. In places like&#160;<br/>Singapore and China and in the rising&#160;economies of the Middle East, we are seeing the&#160;<br/>tremendous benefits that&#160;accrue to the citizenry when governments embrace aviation&#160;as an&#160;<br/>engine for growth and progress, unfettered by punitive taxation regimes. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>In my previous life as&#160;the CEO of Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific I saw first-hand aviation’s&#160;<br/>power to transform economies. Hong Kong, with&#160;a population of just seven million, outperforms&#160;<br/>its size on the world stage because of&#160;connectivity&#160;provided by&#160;aviation. A business-friendly&#160;<br/>approach to&#160;aviation helps attract business to&#160;the city and supports 250,000 aviation related&#160;<br/>jobs. That’s&#160;more than half those in&#160;Canada, which has a population that&#160;is five times larger. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The secret is out. Singapore, South Korea and indeed China are following similar policies to use&#160;<br/>aviation as&#160;a catalyst for jobs, wealth&#160;and prosperity. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Canadian policy-makers should take note. There is no reason that Canada should&#160;be excluded&#160;<br/>from these opportunities.&#160;The country has a long&#160;and special&#160;heritage of aviation. It hosts the&#160;<br/>International Civil Aviation Organization and IATA has made its home in Canada since&#160;1945 as&#160;<br/>a result of a&#160;special act of&#160;the Canadian Parliament. The policy vision of that time clearly&#160;<br/>recognized the importance of being&#160;a leading-edge aviation player to a country with a relatively&#160;<br/>small population spread&#160;over a vast&#160;geography. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Let me be very clear. I am not advocating special treatment for aviation. But it is in Canada’s&#160;<br/>economic interest to allow Canadian aviation to do business from a policy platform that keeps it&#160;<br/>globally competitive. Aviation Day Canada is an&#160;opportunity to rediscover the path towards&#160;<br/>aviation-propelled prosperity that was historically&#160;associated&#160;with this great country.&#160;<br/>&#160;</p>
