<p style="position:absolute;top:329px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft13">&#160;<br/>Good afternoon from Istanbul. And good evening to those joining us in Asia and&#160;<br/>Australia. You will have seen our announcement on Friday about the results of&#160;<br/>September traffic. As you saw in the numbers, we are going through an&#160;<br/>extraordinary time. This has been an extra-ordinary year. At the time of our AGM,&#160;<br/>in Istanbul in June, the industry was in a&#160;cost crisis. You may remember fuel was&#160;<br/>at US$135 per barrel. And we have also highlighted the opportunities and big&#160;<br/>improvements that airlines have done. Since the crisis of 2001, airlines had done&#160;<br/>their homework by improving productivity&#160;64%, improving fuel efficiency by 19%&#160;<br/>and reducing non-fuel unit costs by 18%. But the potential of US$99 billion in&#160;<br/>added fuel costs would require major industry change to be able to survive.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>So during the AGM, we&#160;set forth an Istanbul&#160;declaration that was approved by all&#160;<br/>our members asking our airports and air navigation service providers to deliver&#160;<br/>greater efficiency, asking labour to&#160;understand the need to reduce costs and&#160;<br/>asking governments to stop crazy taxation, regulate monopoly suppliers and&#160;<br/>grant greater commercial freedoms. Since then the situation has changed - the&#160;<br/>price of oil has dropped but the US&#160;credit crunch has evolved into a global&#160;<br/>financial crisis. And the airlines are a part of&#160;that crisis. Passenger traffic is down&#160;<br/>2.9% and cargo is down&#160;7.7% in September. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>So, the crisis inspired the Istanbul declaration. We need change. This was the&#160;<br/>inspiration for the Agenda for Freedom&#160;Summit - to bring airlines greater&#160;<br/>commercial freedoms. IATA put together&#160;and presented a proposal that was&#160;<br/>circulated it among governments. Fourteen national governments agreed to&#160;<br/>participate in the Summit and we’re here&#160;spending two fruitful days with us and&#160;<br/>Mr Shane. Those governments are Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, India,&#160;<br/>Panama, Mauritius, Morocco, Singapore, Switzerland, Turkey, the UAE, the US&#160;<br/>and Vietnam, together with the European Commission (representing 27 nations)&#160;<br/>spent two days with us in Istanbul. Facilitating&#160;a discussion with Governments is&#160;<br/>something completely new for IATA. But in&#160;these very difficult times, we have to&#160;<br/>look for new and innovative solutions.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The opening of the Conference was held by the Turkish Minister for Transport&#160;<br/>who opened the meeting explaining the urgent action that Turkey was taking. I&#160;<br/>presented the point and position of IATA and&#160;explained that in this very difficult&#160;</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:112px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft21">moment, business as usual is not&#160;an option.&#160;The task that we all have today is to&#160;<br/>connect urgent business needs with a broad political vision for change. And we&#160;<br/>have to do this fast because global financial crisis is here. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The goal of&#160;the conference, as I mentioned&#160;in my previous comments that I made&#160;<br/>on Friday, was not to sign an agreement or&#160;come up with a declaration. It was&#160;<br/>important for us to start a process and explain that the process had to move fast.&#160;<br/>So after two days, we had an open and frank discussion with&#160;some important&#160;<br/>outcomes. I will not enter into those details because Mr Jeff Shane, the former&#160;<br/>under-secretary of transport for the US&#160;who very successfully chaired the ICAO&#160;<br/>Assembly in 2007, chaired the conference and will summarize some of the&#160;<br/>results. But I want to emphasize a few key areas that represent progress and&#160;<br/>moving in this direction. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>First, the participants, the governments and those governments around the table&#160;<br/>asked IATA to meet again in early 2009 to&#160;turn words into action. So they&#160;<br/>strongly supported this very unique role that IATA has played.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Second, the states asked IATA to continue and expand this unusual role and, in&#160;<br/>time for the next meeting, to facilitate the creating of a powerful tool that does not&#160;<br/>exist today. This is a multi-lateral statement of policy that expresses the common&#160;<br/>approach of these governments&#160;on liberalization and the key issues of market&#160;<br/>access and ownership.&#160;This is very powerful because it will indicate&#160;a very clear&#160;<br/>direction and a commitment and because it can be developed quickly to be&#160;<br/>useful in this time of crisis as we are going through.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Third, I would like to emphasize in addition to the above, there was a desire of&#160;<br/>the group to spread best their practices to other states by making openly&#160;<br/>available the most liberal agreements that are being negotiated.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>And the most important thing for IATA&#160;is that we achieved momentum, an&#160;<br/>understanding that in times of crisis, we&#160;have to be fast in implementing change.&#160;<br/>And I hope that this meeting of putting together 15 of the world’s most&#160;<br/>progressive&#160;governments will evolve into an&#160;informal fraternity of governments&#160;<br/>acting as agents for change. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The industry will be counting on those present at the meeting to carry these&#160;<br/>messages back to their colleagues at&#160;home and move forward to explore&#160;<br/>opportunities for change with the other countries. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I must emphasize the need for speed in these extra-ordinary times. Look at what&#160;<br/>happened in the banking system. In a week&#160;it became a state industry in many&#160;<br/>countries. This is not the solution that we&#160;want for airlines. But we have already&#160;<br/>seen this happen in Argentina with Aerolineas Argentinas and this could spread&#160;<br/>elsewhere. &#160;<br/>&#160;</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:112px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft33">And lastly I re-emphasize that we are not&#160;asking for any special favours. We are&#160;<br/>not asking for bailouts from governments.&#160;And we are not asking to change&#160;<br/>governments’ role in regulating safety, security, environment standards or&#160;<br/>maintaining a level playing field.&#160;These are and must remain government&#160;<br/>responsibility. But to survive this crisis&#160;and emerge as a stronger&#160;industry airlines&#160;<br/>need the same commercial freedoms that other industries take for granted. I&#160;<br/>underline in my final remarks that the rules&#160;of this game in this industry today are&#160;<br/>exactly the same as when we were&#160;flying&#160;the DC 3s. From the&#160;DC 3s to the 380,&#160;<br/>there is a big difference in technology. It’s the same industry but we still have the&#160;<br/>same tools of that time &#160;<br/>Now, I would like to turn to Mr Jeff Shane, who was as&#160;I mentioned&#160;was the&#160;<br/>chairman of the conference. He&#160;will present the Chairman’s Summary.&#160;<br/>&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:381px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft31"><b>Mr Jeffrey&#160;Shane:&#160;</b></p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:401px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft32">&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:419px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft33">Thanks very much Giovanni. Hello everybody.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I just want to put a little flesh on the bones&#160;of the statement that Mr Bisignani has&#160;<br/>just given. To understand the significance of&#160;what transpired here for the past&#160;<br/>two days, it’s necessary for me to&#160;back up and just put down some basic&#160;<br/>principles about the way international&#160;aviation operates. It’s not very well&#160;<br/>understood among the lay public.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:543px;left:400px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft31"><b>&#160;</b></p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:564px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft33">&#160;<br/>The first thing you need to understand is that&#160;when rules&#160;of international aviation&#160;<br/>were created the governing principle was all of the markets around the world are&#160;<br/>officially closed. It’s not an open market. It’s a closed market and the only way&#160;<br/>that airlines&#160;can actually operate with commercial rights&#160;is through bilateral&#160;<br/>agreements that are&#160;done between states.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;Every route is the product of some&#160;bilateral agreement. There are 3500 bilateral&#160;<br/>agreements that actually are the governing structure, the governing legal&#160;<br/>structure for international&#160;aviation. And those bilateral agreements are very&#160;<br/>carefully calibrated. They say where you&#160;can fly, how many&#160;times a day you can&#160;<br/>fly and how many airlines may fly and where the airlines must be headquartered&#160;<br/>and who must own the airlines. It’s&#160;an incredibly regulatory process.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The other thing that is important to know&#160;and I don’t want to go into great details&#160;<br/>about this, is that this international air transport business, this industry we all&#160;<br/>know so well, we think that its one of&#160;the most international&#160;business that we&#160;<br/>have on the planet. It is in fact one of the least international in term of its&#160;<br/>corporate organization. That’s because all the rules that are promulgated by&#160;<br/>national governments insist&#160;that airlines that are headquartered in their territory&#160;<br/>be owned and controlled by citizens of those countries. They are few exceptions&#160;<br/>beginning to&#160;creep into the picture which&#160;is a good thing. But by large, every&#160;<br/>airline is a national company,&#160;the creature of a single state. And in fact in being&#160;<br/>so, its nationality is almost&#160;a requirement for it to&#160;fly anywhere else. That’s&#160;</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:112px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft42">because other countries will insist&#160;that the airline be the creature of the country&#160;<br/>from which it comes. &#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Every airline that operates internationally according to&#160;the rules of international&#160;<br/>aviation, as&#160;they now exist, must begin&#160;or end every flight in its home country.&#160;<br/>Now, you have read about open skies agreement the latest wrinkle in the&#160;<br/>bilateral agreement process. And there&#160;is no question that governments for the&#160;<br/>last 15-20 years have been attempting to&#160;begin to liberalize some of these&#160;<br/>ancient rules and to facilitate something like an open market for air services. But&#160;<br/>most of the most liberal open skies agreements that we&#160;have today still leave a&#160;<br/>lot of economic restrictions in place, still impede the ability of this airline industry&#160;<br/>to act as though it was&#160;any other globalize network industry.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>It’s those impediments, even in the context of what we call relatively liberal&#160;<br/>bilateral agreements,&#160;that impede this industry’s ability to seek it’s own level of&#160;<br/>economic proposition, to begin to act like it&#160;was a commercial industry, to seek&#160;<br/>opportunities on the basis of commercial&#160;considerations instead of political&#160;<br/>considerations, to really enable itself&#160;to become more economically sustainable&#160;<br/>over the long-term.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;Everybody understands how much value the air transport business brings to&#160;<br/>economies around the world, the global economy in the aggregate. The&#160;<br/>importance therefore of finding a model which enables&#160;the airline industry to&#160;<br/>sustain itself more successfully cannot&#160;be overstated because, unless we have a&#160;<br/>sustainable&#160;air transport system globally, the global economy will suffer. &#160;Air&#160;<br/>transport is essential to the&#160;growth of the global economy.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>So that’s all by way of quick background and&#160;to explain why this meeting was so&#160;<br/>fundamentally important.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Governments have been discussing the need for liberalization for a long time: &#160;<br/>lots of international meetings about that, lots of bilateral meetings&#160;about that. &#160;<br/>What we have never seen in the history of&#160;this discussion is an industry which&#160;<br/>has come to governments and pleaded with&#160;governments to actually liberalize&#160;<br/>the rules</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:815px;left:204px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft41"><b>&#160;</b></p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:815px;left:209px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft40">of the road more then they have already been liberalized. &#160;&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:836px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft42">&#160;<br/>IATA represents the world’s airline industry – 230 international carriers are&#160;<br/>members of IATA. IATA is actually leading the industry and&#160;leading governments&#160;<br/>in a very interesting way, in a way that&#160;I think is unprecedented. I am not aware,&#160;<br/>at least in my experience,&#160;of any similar circumstance.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;So IATA, recognizing that its not in a&#160;position to summon governments, not in a&#160;<br/>position to order governments around,&#160;invited a handful of governments,&#160;<br/>Giovanni just listed them, to&#160;come to Istanbul,&#160;to sit around a table together for&#160;<br/>two days and to consider first of all the&#160;economic circumstances that the industry&#160;<br/>is in right now. A challenge that is historic in its magnitude.&#160;And to consider the&#160;</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:112px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft51">consequences of not addressing that challenge. And to understand better and to&#160;<br/>begin to discuss more clearly the ways in&#160;which the regulatory impediments that&#160;<br/>still exist for this industry, not withstanding its&#160;maturity, are actually impeding its&#160;<br/>ability to help itself overcome some of these challenges.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The regulatory impediments put in&#160;place for the public interest, put in place in&#160;<br/>many cases because of public policy objectives that we might even agree with or&#160;<br/>that we would have agreed with at the&#160;time are now actually preventing the&#160;<br/>industry as becoming as efficient from delivering the quality of service we would&#160;<br/>all like to see.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>So IATA convened the meeting in order&#160;to focus on the extent in which the&#160;<br/>restrictions continue to hamstring the industry and to ask the participating&#160;<br/>governments to consider seriously, given the magnitude of the crisis that we&#160;<br/>have right now, how many of these restrictions actually have continued&#160;<br/>justification. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The going proposition was that governments certainly have a very important&#160;<br/>responsibility and a huge amount of responsibility for safety and security in civil&#160;<br/>aviation. Nobody quarrels with that. There are a lot of requirements however,&#160;<br/>such as the citizenship requirements that&#160;we referred to, such as limitations on&#160;<br/>operating authority, the ability&#160;of an airline to fly to a&#160;destination that might be a&#160;<br/>useful market, restrictions of that&#160;kind which may or may not have continuing&#160;<br/>justification.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>And the conversation around the table with all the government&#160;representatives&#160;<br/>over the last few days was about that&#160;fundamental question. When we come to&#160;<br/>work in the morning, as government officials, we have a lot of responsibilities.&#160;<br/>Let’s make sure these responsibilities&#160;that we actually discharged, have a&#160;<br/>purpose and a meaning, have a reason in the public interest. &#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>So we divided the conversation into specific topics. We talked first about market&#160;<br/>access and market access is nothing but&#160;the ability to fly between countries,&#160;<br/>between cities in different countries.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>To give you a very quick example about how the system&#160;is binding on the&#160;<br/>industry lets look at Turkish Airlines. Turkish Airlines is&#160;a growing, vital, forward&#160;<br/>looking and well equipped&#160;and it’s&#160;an extremely well run&#160;airline. It can fly virtually&#160;<br/>anywhere in the world today as long as&#160;it begins its flights here in Turkey and&#160;<br/>returns to Turkey. If Turkish Airlines,&#160;given the visionary quality of its leadership,&#160;<br/>decided to set-up a hub in Paris and operate from Paris to North America or&#160;<br/>South America or Asia – it would not be permitted to do that. That is not allowed&#160;<br/>under the current scheme. We don’t know&#160;why that is. It would be a big leap to&#160;<br/>turn the system on its head&#160;and actually have that happen.&#160;<br/>&#160;</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:112px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft61">But governments have beginning to discuss that and of course the traditional&#160;<br/>restrictions are simply on the&#160;ability, even if it begins its flight in Turkey, to fly to&#160;<br/>other cities of its choice. It takes a&#160;negotiation, it takes a&#160;treaty-like bilateral&#160;<br/>instrument in order for us to&#160;facilitate the ability for Turkish Airlines to fly to cities&#160;<br/>of its choice. We don’t understand any longer&#160;why that should be the case in the&#160;<br/>year of our Lord 2008. &#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>As Giovanni said, that was the rule&#160;when DC3s were flying and people weren’t&#160;<br/>used to the idea of airplanes coming over their territories and who knows whose&#160;<br/>they were. They had to be protection. But we no longer&#160;are unfamiliar with this&#160;<br/>process. We should be able to accommodate a somewhat more liberal approach&#160;<br/>to the provision of air services. So market access is one category.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The second big category were these rules that just about every country has&#160;<br/>which restrict the flow of capital from offshore, from other countries into its own&#160;<br/>national airline industry. And when I say&#160;most countries it includes the lost&#160;<br/>developed states. The United States has some of the most&#160;restrictive rules in the&#160;<br/>world on this. Rules that are being challenged now by Europe in the context of&#160;<br/>Europe/United States&#160;open skies agreement. The United States has been unable&#160;<br/>over a period of several years, because of&#160;convictions in its own legislature, in&#160;<br/>the US Congress, to change those rules. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>The industry is pleading with governments&#160;around the world to get rid of these&#160;<br/>rules where they cannot be justified by continuing public policy justification. Why&#160;<br/>is it a concern to us? We want to know where the airline is based because we&#160;<br/>want to know what agency is responsible for the safety of that&#160;airline. That is a&#160;<br/>legitimate concern. Governments should regulate the principle place of business&#160;<br/>of an airline. It should regulate the safety of an airline. They should regulate the&#160;<br/>security of an airline. But why should&#160;governments regulate the citizenship of&#160;<br/>investors in the airline? &#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>IATA is bringing that issue to the table and putting it squarely before&#160;<br/>governments and asking governments to&#160;consider seriously whether these&#160;<br/>restrictions continue to have&#160;validity in today’s world.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#160;I can tell you as a lawyer and as a former&#160;under secretary, as Tony said, that in&#160;<br/>representing clients in the&#160;air transport business, I&#160;find myself spending time&#160;<br/>trying to persuade government agencies to&#160;accommodate transactions that are&#160;<br/>simply the most pedestrian, the most mundane, ordinary commercial transactions&#160;<br/>you can imagine. Nobody would ever&#160;have to asked permission in any other&#160;<br/>sector of economic activity. It’s automatically allowed because these are just&#160;<br/>things in the interest of the business. But in the airline industry, because of the&#160;<br/>citizenship, because of the ownership restrictions you have to get permission. &#160;<br/>You have to get permission to tie your shoe&#160;in the airline industry. And that is no&#160;<br/>longer a sensible approach to air transport&#160;given the importance of air transport&#160;<br/>in economic growth and given the challenge&#160;in air transport that exists today. &#160;&#160;</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:112px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft71">&#160;<br/>We talked about how it might be possible if&#160;there was an interest in governments&#160;<br/>to accelerate the liberalization of these rules. We know we can do it by&#160;<br/>agreement - countries get&#160;together and negotiate new agreements. We can do it&#160;<br/>bilaterally or we can do it multilaterally. But by the time we get done with that&#160;<br/>process we probably wouldn’t&#160;have an airline industry.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>So IATA has very creatively suggested&#160;that there might be&#160;other ways. Why can&#160;<br/>governments upon deciding that&#160;there is no continued justification for a particular&#160;<br/>rule, simply waive the rule unilaterally? If&#160;there are restrictions on foreign carriers&#160;<br/>coming to the territory of a country, the country could say that there is no&#160;<br/>justification for that, our citizens would probably like additional competition,&#160;<br/>maybe our national carrier wouldn’t but&#160;the public at large&#160;and the economy at&#160;<br/>large would benefit from more air service.&#160;So why do we have restrictions on it?&#160;<br/>Now if somebody is preventing an airline from flying to their territory, of course&#160;<br/>we would not give it away free of charge - we&#160;will have a reciprocal operation.&#160;<br/>But that’s not often the case. And yet, despite the fact that&#160;the market should be&#160;<br/>mostly open they are not and they need to&#160;be open more. So we could be done&#160;<br/>by a unilateral waiver. &#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>There was a discussion of a multilateral&#160;agreement in which countries would at&#160;<br/>least agree not to worry about the citizenship or the ownership, I should say, of&#160;<br/>airlines that are flying to&#160;its territory. As I said before, if under the bilateral&#160;<br/>agreement, I believe between Turley and France, if an airline wants to fly to&#160;<br/>Turkey from France, that agreement says it must&#160;be owned and controlled by&#160;<br/>French citizens. Since the single market in Europe was developed it has been&#160;<br/>changed now and it must be owned by European&#160;citizens. But if that airline was&#160;<br/>owned by Americans, it wouldn’t be allowed to fly. Turkey&#160;would have to waive a&#160;<br/>restriction in order to allow that airline to fly.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>By a multilateral agreement it would be&#160;possible for governments to simply say&#160;<br/>we shouldn’t care. If we know who is regulating the carrier’s safety and we know&#160;<br/>who is regulating the carrier’s security, we&#160;are quite happy to have it fly here. We&#160;<br/>don’t really care who invested in&#160;it – that’s not a big issue.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>It was a very productive conversation on how&#160;we might achieve a liberalization of&#160;<br/>these foreign ownership restrictions.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That really was the basic content of the conversation of the past two days. As&#160;<br/>Giovanni has already explained, we have agreed in principle that there needs to&#160;<br/>be a follow-up sometimes in 2009. &#160; &#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;&#160;<br/>In between now and then, IATA and others will be developing some materials&#160;<br/>that facilitate more detailed thinking about&#160;how we can do this. Governments will&#160;<br/>report back about how their thinking has been and how their thinking might have&#160;<br/>evolved as a result of this conversation.&#160;</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:112px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft82">&#160;<br/>We will think about the possibility of broadening the group so that we&#160;might&#160;<br/>include a few others either&#160;likeminded or in some case&#160;maybe countries that are&#160;<br/>more on the fence about whether or not&#160;more liberalization is necessary. &#160;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But what we have done here at the behest of IATA, a trade association of&#160;<br/>airlines, is begin a process that we&#160;hope&#160;will rather quickly develop&#160;into a re-<br/>examination of what has been a very restrictive framework for the provision of&#160;<br/>international air services.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>We will continue to be a restrictive framework even under the so-called open&#160;<br/>skies model unless governments examine some other elements that get in the&#160;<br/>way of this industry.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>This industry needs to be able to operate the way other major sectors of&#160;<br/>economic activity operate around the&#160;world. &#160;When you think about the&#160;<br/>advancements we have seen in telecommunications, when you think of the&#160;<br/>advancements we have seen in many other globalized sectors, you&#160;know that it’s&#160;<br/>because they didn’t have to confront these restrictions.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>International aviation is restricted today more or less exactly in the same way it&#160;<br/>was restricted at the dawn of civil aviation.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>It’s time to start rethinking&#160;that framework. I’ll stop.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Thank you.&#160;</p>
