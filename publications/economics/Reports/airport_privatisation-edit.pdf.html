<p style="position:absolute;top:233px;left:433px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft22">Summary</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:209px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft28">Success must be measured not just by the maximisation of revenues from an airport sale, but by whether privatisa-<br/>tion has delivered a cost-effective service of an appropriate quality for the travelling public. &#160;The record with airport<br/>privatisations as with other infrastructure industries is often disappointing. &#160;We extract a number of key lessons for<br/>Governments considering how to privatise airports in the future.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:341px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft24">Ten key lessons for airport privatisation:</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:400px;left:1022px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft28">Successful airport privatisations engage customers as key stakeholders from the outset in establishing the<br/>master plans, financial plans and the economic regulation process and then involve them in an ongoing and<br/>regular basis through agreed processes and full transparency;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:476px;left:1022px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft28">More efficient management is the key to successful privatisation, since cost of capital is almost always high-<br/>er in the private sector;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:533px;left:1022px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft28">Good governance is more important than transferring ownership to the private sector, in order for privatisation<br/>to be in the public interest. &#160;However, privatisation through lease sales will be detrimental to the public inter-<br/>est if royalties to the Government are excessive;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:608px;left:1022px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft28">Independent, robust economic regulation will always be necessary to create incentives for efficiency improve-<br/>ments and for sharing these gains with customers, in the private monopolies created by privatisation. &#160;If the<br/>Government retains a shareholding and controls the economic regulator, there is automatically an unaccept-<br/>able conflict of interest;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:701px;left:1022px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft28">The most successful economic regulation has been where the regulator is also overseen by an independent<br/>Competition Commission to prevent too comfortable a relationship between the regulator and the regulated<br/>entity;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:777px;left:1022px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft28">Economic regulators have sometimes been good at extracting maximum value from existing assets, but have<br/>not been good at ensuring cost-effectiveness from new investment;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:834px;left:1022px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft28">Mechanisms to incentivise cost efficiency and continuous improvements must be built in from the outset. &#160;CPI-<br/>X price cap regulation will create the incentives for efficiency improvement, whereas direct or rate-of-return<br/>regulation risks preserving monopoly profits and inefficiencies in the early stages of a privatised airport; &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:909px;left:1022px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft28">In order to ensure good quality as well as cost-effective service, it is essential to have in place service level<br/>agreements (or similar systems) to ensure that service quality standards are maintained and improved;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:966px;left:1022px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft28">Controls must be put in place to prevent unjustified asset revaluations and moves to dual-till accounting, which<br/>leave costs common to both aeronautical and commercial services, burdening airlines and their passengers<br/>with substantial charge increases;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1042px;left:1022px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft28">A new model, for structuring infrastructure providers in the private sector, is emerging, which could in theory<br/>better serve customers; a debt-financed private company structure limited by guarantee, accountable to a<br/>board of customers and business partners. &#160;In practice this still may not prevent 'gold-plating' on investment<br/>programmes. &#160;Customer involvement remains essential;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:92px;left:1518px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft25">01 - Airport Privatisation&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:374px;left:303px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft29">This paper examines the success or<br/>otherwise of twelve airport privatisa-<br/>tions in Europe, Asia and Latin<br/>America, and the lessons learnt.&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:569px;left:303px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft29">It also looks for lessons from the past<br/>twenty years of privatisation in other<br/>infrastructure industries.&#160;</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:385px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft30">SYDNEY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (SYD), AUSTRALIA</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:417px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft37">The experience of SYD privatisation has been that, although service quality is &#160;judged good by passengers, air-<br/>lines are less satisfied and charges are high;<br/>The problem is that formal price-cap economic regulation was abandoned in favour of 'light-handed' price sur-<br/>veillance, after SYD appeared to be 'fattened' for sale with asset revaluations and a move to a dual till. &#160;Mandatory<br/>price monitoring by the ACCC does not provide sufficient incentive to improve efficiency or to reduce costs to<br/>the users.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:551px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft30">PERTH AIRPORT (PER), AUSTRALIA</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:584px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft37">In the case of PER privatisation, the absence of economic regulation since 2002 has led large charge increas-<br/>es with no corresponding rise in services or any significant capital investment;<br/>The absence of economic regulation, together with asset revaluation and the use of a dual till, has meant large<br/>charge increase for customers.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:682px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft30">EZEIZA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (EZE), ARGENTINA</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:714px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft37">Privatisation of EZE has been a very bad deal for customers. &#160;The structure of the lease sale has meant very high<br/>charges, under-investment and poor customer service quality;<br/>The absence of an independent economic regulator and the clear conflict of interest as apparent from extreme-<br/>ly high royalty fees has lead to a very confrontational relationship between Government, airport operator and cus-<br/>tomers to the benefit of none.&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:831px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft30">JUAN SANTAMARIA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (SJO), COSTA RICA</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:863px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft37">The privatisation of SJO has also been marred by royalties of 40-45% of total airport revenues, which are hin-<br/>dering the required development of the airport. &#160;Moreover there is no independent economic regulation of<br/>charges.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:939px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft30">JORGE CHAVEZ INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (LIM), PERU</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:972px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft37">In the case of LIM royalty fees are even higher at 46% of total revenues. &#160;This, and the absence of independent<br/>economic regulation, has meant the airport operator is constantly attempting to introduce new and higher<br/>charges.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1048px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft30">ATHENS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (AIA), GREECE</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1080px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft37">Service quality at AIA is good but that comes at a very high price for its customers, in the 3rd highest charges in<br/>the world. &#160;Moreover, the regulated target rate of return of 15% ensures monopoly profits are achieved at the<br/>expense of its captive customer base.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:385px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft30">BRITISH AIRPORTS AUTHORITY (BAA), UK</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:417px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft37">A good example of how to privatise an airport successfully and implement effective economic regulation of exist-<br/>ing assets;<br/>However, less effective economic regulation of new investment has led to a recent sharp rise in airport charges,<br/>and potentially inefficient investment.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:515px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft30">COPENHAGEN AIRPORT (CPH), DENMARK</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:548px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft37">This has been a relatively successful privatisation with good service quality and relatively low charges;<br/>Economic regulation has been effective with a formal incentive-based CPI-X system at the ready should negoti-<br/>ation fail. &#160;However, there is a potential conflict of interest with the remaining 34% Government ownership.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:628px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft30">VIENNA AIRPORT (VIE), AUSTRIA</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:660px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft37">Privatisation of VIE has resulted in inadequate investment and high charges for customers;<br/>Before privatisation VIE had high costs. &#160;Very weak economic regulation has done little to change this providing<br/>no incentive to improve efficiency, provide adequate investment, or hold back monopoly profits.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:741px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft30">ZURICH AIRPORT (ZRH), SWITZERLAND</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:773px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft37">The privatisation of ZRH was setback by the demise of Swissair, its main customer, but has resulted in few effi-<br/>ciency gains and it is one of the most expensive airports in the world;<br/>The absence of independent economic regulation and the use of a dual till means there is little incentive for effi-<br/>ciency gains, or offsets to monopoly power in order to share any such gains with customers in lower charges.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:872px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft30">BRUSSELS AIRPORT (BRU), BELGIUM</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:904px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft37">The economic regulation structure put in place after privatisation provides little reassurance for customers. &#160;In<br/>particular rate-of-return regulation and the potential to link charges to a reference group of airports provides lit-<br/>tle incentive for cost efficiency improvements to reduce airport charges;&#160;<br/>The regulation does however increase the level of transparency given to users, and names IATA as a represen-<br/>tative organization in the consultation process.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1020px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft30">AUCKLAND INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (AIA), NEW ZEALAND</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1053px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft37">The privatisation of AIA has resulted in one of the most profitable airports in the world, but subject to ongoing<br/>airline criticism over excessive charging;<br/>The absence of effective economic regulation and an inflated asset base has allowed monopoly profits to per-<br/>sist. &#160;Of major concern is the Government's decision to reject the Commerce Commission's recommendation that<br/>airfield charges be subject to some form of control.</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:299px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft45">There are now over twenty years of experience with the privatisation of infrastructure providers from many industries.<br/>Although considerable amounts have been raised from the sale of public assets to the private sector, the benefits to<br/>the customer and the public interest in general have been less clear. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:362px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft41">There are a number of lessons that can be drawn from this experience.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:412px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft42">Key points:</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:113px;left:294px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft52">Introduction</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:209px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft57">Airports have until recently been under full Government ownership. &#160;This remains the case in the United States where<br/>airports are owned by local government and financed mainly through ticket and fuel taxes and bond issues, with air-<br/>lines owning and operating their own terminals. &#160;However, European governments in particular, and increasingly<br/>those in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, have privatised many of their larger airports.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:307px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft54">WHAT EXACTLY DO WE MEAN BY PRIVATISATION? &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:339px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft57">Since 1982 'privatisation' has become a generic term to describe a range of market-oriented reforms of public sec-<br/>tor institutions, including airports and air navigation service providers:</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:384px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft57">The full or partial sale to private companies of government assets, usually with the establishment of an<br/>autonomous regulator unless competition can be introduced;<br/>The leasing of assets for long-term operation and development by private companies;<br/>The liberalisation or the introduction of competition. &#160;In practice, this is not possible with airports or air navigation<br/>service providers, and so will not be considered in this paper. &#160;Competition for the purchase of the privatised<br/>asset or its operation is possible and desirable, but once that has occurred the provider becomes a private<br/>monopoly.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:541px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft54">WHAT MAKES IT A SUCCESS? &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:573px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft57">For privatisation to be in the public interest, rather than just a revenue-raising exercise or a ploy to shift assets off<br/>balance sheet for government, it must result in a more efficient management of the infrastructure assets. &#160;This is the<br/>critical yardstick by which the success or failure of a privatisation must be judged. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:635px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft57">Privatisation is not about more efficient finance. &#160;The Government is almost always the best borrower, at least in<br/>developed economies. &#160;Under the public limited company 'plc' model of privatisation the cost of capital may be 6%<br/>points higher than what it would cost the government. &#160;In order to succeed for customers, private sector manage-<br/>ment must more than offset this additional cost by efficiency gains. &#160;A strong and efficient economic regulator will<br/>be a necessary prerequisite for this to be achieved by infrastructure providers, who almost always operate in markets<br/>with weak or absent competitive pressures.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:752px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft57">But the success of economic regulation is mixed where the interests of managers are not aligned with their cus-<br/>tomers, which may be the case with, for example, powerful shareholders. &#160;Boosting shareholder returns and man-<br/>agers own share options may not always be consistent with providing customers with a cost effective service of the<br/>right quality. &#160;Managers must also balance the need to provide a cost efficient service for customers, with the (some-<br/>times) conflicting objectives of service quality and safety. &#160;Many privatisations in the past 23 years have failed to<br/>achieve this. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:886px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft54">EARLY MODEL BEING CONSIDERED &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:919px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft57">Following these failures the momentum of privatisation has slowed sharply in Europe. &#160;The collapse of Railtrack in<br/>the UK and the necessity to financially restructure privatised NATS, the UK air navigation service provider, among<br/>others, has led to transport infrastructure privatisation being found unsatisfactory in the very country that originally<br/>promoted it.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:999px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft57">As a result a new model, of structuring infrastructure providers in the private sector, is emerging, which could in the-<br/>ory better serve the interests of customers; a debt-financed private company structure limited by guarantee, account-<br/>able to a board of customers and business partners. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1062px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft57">Along with infrastructure businesses in rail and water supply, one of the first to adopt this new model was NAV<br/>CANADA. &#160;It remains to be seen whether in practice this company structure delivers cost efficiency as well as serv-<br/>ice quality. &#160;The case of Toronto Airport where 'gold-plated' terminal investments occurred, despite this type of cor-<br/>porate structure, raises some doubts. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1142px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft57">It is clear that economic regulation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for successful privatisation. &#160;Better gov-<br/>ernance is essential too. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:92px;left:1518px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft55">02 - Airport Privatisation</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:262px;left:303px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft59">Privatisation, as a policy, began in<br/>1982 with the sale to individual<br/>investors of 51% of British Telecom,<br/>which launched a radical change in<br/>public policy in Britain and around the<br/>world. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:535px;left:303px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft59">BAA, in the UK, was the first major air-<br/>port privatisation with a full floatation<br/>of its shares in 1987.&#160;</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:793px;left:102px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft68">BRITISH AIRPORTS AUTHORITY (BAA), UK</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:826px;left:128px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft612">A good example of how to privatise an airport successfully and implement effective economic regulation of<br/>existing assets;<br/>However, less effective economic regulation of new investment has lead to a sharp rise in airport charges, and<br/>potentially inefficient investment.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:929px;left:102px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft612">BAA was transferred to the private sector in 1987 by the UK Conservative Government, through a public floata-<br/>tion that raised $2.3 billion. &#160;Following its previous management by a government bureaucracy, BAA became a<br/>public limited company accountable to its shareholders and the economic regulator, with each airport being a sub-<br/>sidiary and having limited autonomy. &#160;Since privatisation the company has diversified, managing airports overseas<br/>and taking equity stakes in aviation and non-aviation companies in the UK and overseas. &#160;It has become particu-<br/>larly successful in developing its non-aeronautical revenues at its airports. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1045px;left:102px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft612">As a result of BAA's effective monopoly position in London and the SE of England the regulator capped landing<br/>and passenger charges at the three largest BAA airports from the time of privatisation. &#160;Effective economic reg-<br/>ulation has been critical to the success of this privatisation, which, until recently, has kept aeronautical charges rel-<br/>atively low with satisfactory service quality. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1126px;left:102px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft612">The independent TRL Charges Index of the top-50 airports worldwide ranks Heathrow 27th and Gatwick 42nd in<br/>2004 i.e. at present relatively low priced. &#160;Evenso, in 2003 BAA's operating profit margin was 30.6%, generating<br/>a pre-tax return on capital (ROIC) of 7.8%.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:579px;left:377px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft610">Sale of airports to private</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:615px;left:377px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft610">companies and investors</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:680px;left:377px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft612">So far there have been a relatively small number of airports<br/>that have been privatised through the full or partial sale of<br/>the assets to private investors. &#160;Most of these have taken<br/>place in Europe and New Zealand.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:206px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft611">The key elements to the effectiveness of economic regulation have been:</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:235px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft612">The independence of the regulator. &#160;This is established in principle through legislation, but in practice through<br/>the role of the UK Competition Commission's ability to recommend to the CAA whether or not the regulator's<br/>decision is in the public interest or not. &#160;Note that there needs to be constant vigilance against what is known as<br/>'regulatory capture' by too close a relationship between regulator and regulated airport leading to excessive<br/>investment and charge levels. &#160;Having a Competition Commission acting in the public interest is critical;<br/>Efficiency improvements generated by incentive-based price regulation, as opposed to other forms of price reg-<br/>ulation such as 'rate of return'. &#160;Price caps on landing and passenger charges over a 5-year period (which gives<br/>customers and airports certainty) took the form of CPI-X, that is the general rate of consumer price inflation<br/>minus an efficiency factor. &#160;Note that price caps need to be set so that airport profits are not too far in excess of<br/>their cost of capital, and to address the common practice of airports over-estimating the investment they expect<br/>to incur - both of which lead to excessive charging;<br/>Quality of service was ensured by setting measurable quality and service level standards under the regulatory<br/>arrangements. &#160;Note that if such standards are not set, then incentive-based RPI-X price regulation could lead<br/>to a reduction in service quality in order to improve airport profits;<br/>Costs of other essential customer services not covered by the price cap (e.g. check-in desk rentals) are taken<br/>into account by being included in a 'single till'. &#160;The 'single till' principle ensures that the profits generated through<br/>commercial activities by the passengers, brought by airlines to the airport, are taken into account when setting<br/>the level of airport charges. &#160;Note that such a &#160;practice is justified by, for example, the UK Competition<br/>Commission, on the grounds that the measured profits derived from commercial activities exclude the common<br/>costs of landing and passenger services, without which such incomes could not be generated. &#160;Further, the appli-<br/>cation of the single till also eliminates the need for stringent cost allocation requirements, which in the best of<br/>cases has been found to be extremely complex;<br/>Strong and informed regulators are required to challenge the airport's own projections for asset valuation, oper-<br/>ating and capital expenses, traffic forecasts and non-regulated commercial revenues. &#160;Note that realistic and rea-<br/>sonable estimates are required to set the price caps to allow the airport to earn its cost of capital, but maintain<br/>incentives to improve efficiency;<br/>While the UK economic regulator is considered to have done a good job at extracting maximum value from exist-<br/>ing assets, the airline customers of London Heathrow consider that now substantial new investment is under-<br/>way, price caps have been too generous. &#160;The 2003-08 price caps of RPI+6.5% have resulted in actual charge<br/>increases of 12% for 2005-06. &#160;It is not clear to customers that this pre-financing of future investment will deliv-<br/>er the most cost efficient increase in service levels. &#160;Note that regulators need to ensure that there are sufficient<br/>incentives to deliver the most cost efficient new investment as well as cost efficient existing operations.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:865px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft68">COPENHAGEN AIRPORT (CPH), DENMARK</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:897px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft612">This has been a relatively successful privatisation with good service quality and relatively low charges;<br/>Economic regulation has been effective with a formal incentive-based CPI-X system at the ready should negoti-<br/>ation fail. &#160;However, there is a potential conflict of interest with the remaining 34% Government ownership.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:982px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft612">The Danish Government privatised CPH in several stages. &#160;In 1994 there was a public floatation of 25% of the com-<br/>pany's shares, followed by a further 24% in 1996. &#160;Since then the Government has reduced its stake from 51% to<br/>34%. &#160;No one investor is allowed to hold more than 10% of the stock. &#160;Since privatisation the airport operator has<br/>diversified and has developed and operated airports overseas in countries as diverse as Mexico and China.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1062px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft612">A new economic regulation regime was put in place to run from 2003 to 2008, which caps prices for a 3-year peri-<br/>od either by negotiation with airlines or, if unsuccessful, by regulation. &#160;Effective economic regulation and sensible<br/>airport management have been critical to the success of this privatisation, which has kept aeronautical charges rel-<br/>atively low and service quality high.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1143px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft612">The independent TRL Charges Index of the top-50 airports worldwide ranks CPH 26th in 2004 i.e. relatively low<br/>priced, and in 2003 was ranked best in Europe and 2nd in the world in IATA's customer satisfaction survey.&#160;</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:209px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft74">Classic monopolist behaviour is to restrict output in order to boost profit margins. &#160;The inadequate investment<br/>programme appears to demonstrate this outcome. &#160;There are insufficient incentives for cost-efficient investment;<br/>There are few check and balances with the absence of a Competition Commission nor an independent econom-<br/>ic regulator with a clear madate to act in the public interest.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:329px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft71">ZURICH AIRPORT (ZRH), SWITZERLAND</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:362px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft74">The privatisation of ZRH was setback by the demise of Swissair, its main customer, but has resulted in few effi-<br/>ciency gains and it is one of the most expensive airports in the world;<br/>The absence of independent economic regulation and the use of a dual till means there is little incentive for effi-<br/>ciency gains, or pressure to offset monopoly power to share any such gains with customers in lower charges.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:464px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft74">Zurich airport was partially privatised in 2000 with 42% of its shares held by private investors, but a controlling inter-<br/>est held by regional and local government. &#160;The operators of ZRH made substantial investments in order to develop<br/>non-aeronautical revenues along the lines of BAA, but have done little in the way of diversification overseas with just<br/>three management contracts at airports in Chile.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:545px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft74">There is little in the way of economic regulation with charges determined by ZRH itself. &#160;The role of the Federal Office<br/>for Civil Aviation is only to verify that legal provisions and international directives have been observed. &#160;There is a ver-<br/>sion of a Competition Commission in the Price Surveillance Authority that acts as some constraint to excessive<br/>charging. &#160;However, this has not prevented ZRH from exerting its dominant market position to impose high charges<br/>on its customers.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:643px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft74">The independent TRL Charges Index of the top-50 airports worldwide ranks ZRH as the 10th most expensive air-<br/>port in 2004. &#160;However, it ranks as one of the least profitable of the top-50 airports. &#160;Much of this is due to substan-<br/>tial excess capacity following the collapse of Swissair, its main customer. &#160;But, in addition, there is an absence of any<br/>regulatory regime to incentivise efficiency improvements. &#160;In 2002 ZRH made an operating profit of 11.9% generat-<br/>ing an ROIC of 2.3%. &#160;Nonetheless, this rate of return exceeds that of most of its airline customers.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:767px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft72">The major problems with this privatisation have been:</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:796px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft74">The absence of any independent economic regulator to check ZRH's market power as a private natural monop-<br/>oly over much of its customer base. &#160;The Price Surveillance Authority has acted as a brake to some recent<br/>increases but there has been little incentive for efficiency improvements by ZRH. &#160;An incentive-based CPI-X price<br/>cap would be necessary to achieve this;<br/>The airport has also switched from single to dual-till. &#160;As a result aeronautical charges bear the full cost of pro-<br/>viding aircraft and passenger services. &#160;Yet many of these are common costs necessary for the airport to provide<br/>commercial services. &#160;Commercial service income and profits could not be generated without incurring the costs<br/>of the aeronautical services associated with delivering the customers i.e. airline passengers.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:989px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft71">BRUSSELS AIRPORT (BRU)&#160;BELGIUM &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1021px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft74">The economic regulation structure put in place after privatisation provides little reassurance for customers. &#160;In<br/>particular rate-of-return regulation and the potential to link charges to a reference group of airports provides lit-<br/>tle incentive for cost efficiency improvements to reduce airport charges.<br/>The regulation does however increase the level of transparency given to users, and names IATA as a represen-<br/>tative organization in the consultation process.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1142px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft74">At the end of 2004 BRU was privatised through the sale of 70% of its shares to a consortium of private investors,<br/>rather than a public flotation of the stock. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:209px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft74">It is clear that efficiency improvements are key to this success since shareholders are also benefiting. &#160;In 2002 CPH<br/>had an operating profit margin of 36.5%, which generated an ROIC of 11.1%.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:274px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft72">The key elements to the effectiveness of economic regulation have been:</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:303px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft74">If negotiation fails, then regulated price caps will create an incentive for further efficiency improvements. &#160;This is<br/>an important mechanism to encourage the airport to come to a reasonable negotiated agreement with airline<br/>customers. &#160;The incentive-based CPI-X formula incorporates both additional efficiency improvements in the 'X'<br/>factor but also a portion of the previous year's passenger traffic growth to claw back any excessive charges<br/>resulting from traffic overshooting airport forecasts;<br/>However, this new regulatory structure may not be delivering as much as it could. &#160;The first regulated period from<br/>2003-2005 saw a negotiated agreement to increase charges by 2.75% a year. &#160;However, inflation over this peri-<br/>od looks set to average less than the European Central Bank's 2% target i.e. in practice the price cap has been<br/>CPI+1%. &#160;This is unlikely to have been a very strong incentive for efficiency improvements. &#160;Unlike the UK situ-<br/>ation there is no Competition Commission to act in the interest of the customer and ensure the economic regu-<br/>lator set appropriate price caps. &#160;Moreover, the economic regulator is the Ministry of Transport and not an inde-<br/>pendent body. &#160;Since the Dutch Government hold 34% of the shares in CPH there is a potential conflict of inter-<br/>est. &#160;The checks and balances of a Competition Commission acting in the public interest and the independence<br/>of the economic regulator are key factors to restrict the market power of airports in customer charge negotia-<br/>tions.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:622px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft71">VIENNA AIRPORT (VIE), AUSTRIA</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:654px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft74">Privatisation of VIE has resulted in inadequate investment and high charges for customers;<br/>Before privatisation VIE had high costs. &#160;Very weak economic regulation has done little to change this providing<br/>no incentive to improve efficiency, provide adequate investment, or hold back monopoly profits.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:739px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft74">VIE was a public corporation before privatisation in 1992, with very high staff costs. &#160;At the end of the 1980s its rev-<br/>enue to expenses ratio was 1.1 compared to others such as London Heathrow with 1.5. &#160;A key success criteria for<br/>privatisation was the elimination of this inefficiency. &#160;Partial privatisation took place in 1992 with 50% of VIE shares<br/>held by private investors (of which 34.8% is freely floated on the Vienna Stock Exchange) and 10% held by a VIE<br/>employees fund. &#160;Regional and local government hold the remaining 40%. &#160;The VIE operator has not been active in<br/>developing non-aeronautical revenues with these only representing 23% of turnover.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:856px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft74">The economic regulatory regime provides little incentive for efficiency improvements or new investment. &#160;As a result<br/>costs and charges have always been high at VIE as the airport has appeared to use its monopoly position, with little<br/>opposition from the regulator, to deliver an inefficient and highly priced service to its customers. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:918px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft74">The independent TRL Charges Index of the top-50 airports worldwide ranks VIE 13th most expensive in 2004.<br/>Moreover, planned investment to 2008 is not expected to prevent capacity constraints being reached, but the invest-<br/>ment programme has been cut back reportedly in order to maintain VIE's high dividend payout ratio. &#160;In 2002 VIE<br/>made an operating profit margin of 36% generating an ROIC of 13.1%, making it the 6th most profitable airport in<br/>the world.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1042px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft72">The main problems resulting from the privatisation of VIE have been:</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1071px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft74">Direct regulation of charges that creates no incentive for efficiency improvements, unlike the CPI-X approach.<br/>Charges had, until recently, been based on a simple formula, rising with forecast inflation with some reduction<br/>for higher traffic i.e. in essence a cost-plus approach. &#160;Late in 2004 the regime appeared to shift to a more direct<br/>regulation of the charge level. &#160;Charges were reduced 5% in responses to customer complaints. &#160;More funda-<br/>mentally there has been little incentive for VIE to address the high cost base that causes its charges to be among<br/>the highest in the world;</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:209px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft87">Previously private investors had been involved in the ownership of the airport and the Belgian Government had a<br/>63.5% shareholding. &#160;Today's consortium is led by the Australian infrastructure investor and manager Macquarie<br/>Airports which now has a 52% share in BIAC. &#160;The demise of flag carrier Sabena and competition from Charleroi<br/>Airport and high-speed rail adds to the challenge for the new owners. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:289px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft87">The economic regulation placed on the airport imposes a price-cap which can be set in order to allow a particular<br/>rate of return on regulated assets, rather than to create incentives to improve efficiency. &#160;The first 5-year regulatory<br/>period is due to begin in 2006. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:352px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft87">The TRL Charges Index places BIAC 20th in 2004. &#160;In 2002 BIAC were getting a 10.2% operating profit margin and<br/>generating a 2.8% ROIC.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:396px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft80">It is too early to determine the success or draw lessons from this recent privatisation. &#160; &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:463px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft81">AUCKLAND INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (AIA), NEW ZEALAND</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:495px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft87">The privatisation of AIA has resulted in one of the most profitable airports in the world, but it remains subject to<br/>ongoing airline criticism over excessive charging;<br/>The absence of effective economic regulation and an inflated asset base has allowed monopoly profits to per-<br/>sist. &#160;Of major concern is the Government's decision to reject the Commerce Commission's recommendation that<br/>airfield charges be subject to some form of control.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:616px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft87">Auckland International Airport was privatised in 1998 when the New Zealand government sold its 51% stake in a<br/>public floatation. &#160;Later the Auckland City Council sold half of its 25.6% stake to private investors. &#160;Overseas investors<br/>now hold 36% of AIA shares. &#160;AIA has been aggressive in developing non-aeronautical revenues, which represent-<br/>ed 48% of total revenues last year. &#160;For example there is a car dealership on the airport site and AIA even sold elec-<br/>tricity at one time.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:714px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft87">Airport charges are essentially unregulated, despite privatisation turning AIA into a private natural monopoly. &#160;The air-<br/>port company is obliged to simply consult with its airline customers over charges at least once every five years, and<br/>to consult regarding significant capital expenditure programmes. &#160;It retains the legal power at the end of the consul-<br/>tation process to set such charges as it thinks fit. &#160;However, the Government retains the power to regulate airport<br/>charges. &#160;In 2002 the Commerce Commission recommended that the Government implement direct regulation of<br/>AIA charges, under the process set out in the 1986 Commerce Act. &#160;The Government has decided not to pursue this<br/>course of action. &#160;This light-handed regulation has proved costly for customers.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:849px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft87">AIA is no longer included in the TRL Charges Index but is certainly considered by airline users as one of the more<br/>expensive airports. &#160;It is clear that AIA is one of the most profitable airports in the world. &#160;In 2003 it made an oper-<br/>ating profit margin of 58.6% generating an ROIC of almost 18%.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:937px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft82">The key problems with this privatisation have been:</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:966px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft87">There is no effective economic regulation to prevent AIA abusing its dominant market position or to create the<br/>incentives for efficiency improvements. &#160;As a result customers have faced excessive charges;<br/>The asset base and operating costs on which charges are based have been inflated. &#160;Land is valued at a high<br/>market value and includes areas the airlines do not consider necessary for airport purposes. &#160;Moreover, the cost<br/>of capital used by AIA appears overly high which, particularly when coupled with excessive asset valuations, adds<br/>to costs and the base for charges.</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:352px;left:981px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft81">SYDNEY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (SYD), AUSTRALIA</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:384px;left:1006px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft87">The experience of SYD privatisation has been that, although service quality is judged good by passengers, air-<br/>lines are less satisfied and charges are high;<br/>The problem is that economic regulation was abandoned, after SYD appeared to be 'fattened' for sale with asset<br/>revaluation and a move to a dual till. &#160;Mandatory price monitoring by the ACCC does not provide sufficient incen-<br/>tive to improve efficiency or to reduce costs to the users.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:505px;left:981px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft87">The sale of a 50-year lease with a 49-year option for the development and operation of Sydney International Airport<br/>was undertaken in June 2002, raising A$5.6 billion. &#160;The Australian Government retains ownership but sold 100%<br/>of the operating and development rights to a consortium of private investors, led by Macquarie Bank and Hochtief.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:567px;left:981px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft87">On the privatisation of SYD, and following a review by the Australian Productivity Commission, incentive-based CPI-<br/>X price cap regulation at Australian airports was ended. &#160;There is now no direct economic regulation of airport charg-<br/>ing, despite their market power as private natural monopolies. &#160;There is mandatory price monitoring by the Australian<br/>Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Aviation Group, which does not provide incentives for cutting costs<br/>or to reduce prices to the users.&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:666px;left:981px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft87">Although ACCC's Service Quality Monitoring Report indicates that service quality is rated good to very good by pas-<br/>sengers, and satisfactory to good by airline customers, some airlines consider that this report is a poor substitute for<br/>a comprehensive Service Level Agreement. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:728px;left:981px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft87">Sydney Airport Corporation Limited currently offers no services standards, KPIs or commercial consequences for<br/>non-performance. &#160;There is also no framework for performance management of service level issues. &#160;Moreover, with<br/>no direct or incentive-based regulation on SYD there is little pressure for efficiency improvements.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:791px;left:981px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft87">It is no surprise that the TRL Charges Index ranks SYD as the 18th most expensive airport in 2004. &#160;In 2003 SYD<br/>made an operating profit margin of 45.5% generating an ROIC of 3.4%.&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:861px;left:981px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft82">The key problems with this privatisation have been:</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:890px;left:1006px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft87">Although charges have not risen far since privatisation there was a 97% increase just before privatisation in<br/>2001, on the grounds that this would allow SYD to earn a commercial rate of return;<br/>However, this rise was justified first on the basis of a dual till. &#160;As a result aeronautical charges will bear the full<br/>cost of providing aircraft and passenger services, yet many of these are common costs necessary for the airport<br/>to provide commercial services;<br/>Second, aeronautical assets were revalued just before privatisation which further raised the level of charges nec-<br/>essary to achieve the commercial rate of return;<br/>The above are problems with the privatisation process. &#160;However, now that SYD has been privatised the key<br/>problem is the lack of price-cap economic regulation. The ACCC is a similar body to the Competition<br/>Commission in the UK, but the key difference is that there is no incentive-based price cap in place to encour-<br/>age SYD to improve its efficiency. &#160;Not only does price monitoring create no incentives for cost efficiency<br/>improvements, the ACCC has limited powers of enforcement which can be overridden by the Government. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:242px;left:1265px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft87">In Australia and Latin America (and also Greece) the privati-<br/>sation option taken by Government owners of airports has<br/>not been to sell ownership but to lease the airports for long-<br/>term development and/or operation by private companies.</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:206px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft90">Some of the key problems with this and other privatisations in Latin America are:</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:235px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft94">Sales of leases or concessions were structured in such a way that they almost inevitably led to sharp increases<br/>in charges, with no corresponding rise in service. &#160;Many lease sales were made on the basis of unrealistically high<br/>traffic forecasts and the bidding process led to high royalties, both of which severely damaged profitability.<br/>Airport operators have tried to recoup these losses by raising charges on airline customers and cutting back<br/>investment plans;<br/>There was very little flexibility built into the 30-year lease contracts, particularly in respect of royalty payments,<br/>restricting the ability of airport operators to adapt to changed market circumstances;<br/>The absence of independent economic regulation of charges and an independent economic regulator or other<br/>body acting in the public interest has led to a damaging rise in charges and decline in service quality. &#160;There is<br/>no incentive for improvements in cost-efficiency that a CPI-X type price cap would deliver. &#160;Conflicts of interest<br/>abound with, for example, part of airport royalties paying the salaries of the regulator;<br/>There is no effective mechanism for customer interests to be represented in decisions about charge or service<br/>levels. &#160;Although lease contracts specify customer consultation, there is no effective regulatory body to ensure<br/>the monopoly airport takes any notice;<br/>Investment in new capacity has been inefficient, due to the lack of economic regulation or customer consulta-<br/>tion. &#160;In some airports there has been excessive investment in terminal facilities, while in others there has been<br/>under-investment;<br/>Resources are being drained from the industry through lease royalty payments to Government which are not<br/>used to fund aviation infrastructure. &#160;Moreover, cross-subsidy from more efficient airports to inefficient airports<br/>are raising and distorting charge levels for customers, and provide a disincentive for efficiency improvements;<br/>There is no competition among service providers at airports, such as catering, ground-handling etc. &#160;The monop-<br/>oly provision of these services leads to inefficiency and high charges.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:701px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft92">JUAN SANTAMARIA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (SJO), COSTA RICA</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:734px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft94">The privatisation of SJO has also been marred by royalties of 40-45% of total airport revenues, which are hin-<br/>dering the required development of the airport. &#160;Moreover there is no independent economic regulation of<br/>charges.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:814px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft94">In 1999 the Government of Costa Rica sold a 20-year lease on Juan Santamaria International Airport to an interna-<br/>tional consortium of investors and airport operators, led by UK-based Alterra Partners. &#160;The cost was a 35.5% royal-<br/>ty that, with additional fees and taxes, reached 40-45% of total airport revenues being remitted to the Government. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:877px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft94">There is no independent economic regulation of charges and service quality. &#160;However, the Government has set up<br/>a commission to determine a model for setting customer charges. &#160;After pressure from airline customers the<br/>Government's Comptroller General has recognized mistakes in the approval process of airport fees, lowering and<br/>freezing charges. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:957px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft94">However, there is still no incentive mechanism for efficiency improvements or for any such improvements to be<br/>passed on to customers, at least in part, in lower charges. &#160;Moreover, service quality is suffering as the investment<br/>programme has been halted due to disputes by the airport operator with the Government over the terms of the lease<br/>contract. &#160;Currently there is a renegotiation process in order to set a new economic model that will give continuity to<br/>this project. &#160;The delay in the negotiation process has benefited customers because charges have not been reviewed<br/>or increased since 2002.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1074px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft94">The same list of problems with the way in which EZE was privatised and the lack of economic regulation once pri-<br/>vatised apply to SJO.</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:235px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft94">In the case of PER privatisation in the absence of economic regulation has led to large charge increases with no<br/>corresponding rise in services or any significant capital investment;<br/>The absence of economic regulation, together with asset revaluation and the use of a dual till, has meant large<br/>charge increase for customers.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:338px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft94">Perth Airport was sold on a 50-year lease with a 49-year option, with the Government retaining ownership. &#160;The long-<br/>term lease was bought in 1997 by Westralia Airports Corporation Pty Ltd (WAC) for A$ 639 million.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:383px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft94">In the five years following privatisation PER was subject to price cap economic regulation, though that has since been<br/>replaced by a mandatory price-monitoring regime, leaving airport charges unregulated. &#160;Quality of terminal service is<br/>generally rated good by passengers, and airside service quality is rated by airlines as satisfactory or good.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:445px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft94">However, the replacement of economic regulation with mandatory price monitoring in 2002 resulted in the airport<br/>increasing charges by 70% on average without a corresponding rise in service quality or major capital investments.<br/>In addition PER imposes a fuel throughput levy on jet fuel at the airport.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:508px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft94">This increase in charges was justified on the basis of the dual-till system and the revaluation of assets that had been<br/>allowed by the ACCC at SYD. &#160;PER made an operating profit margin of 63.9% in 2004 generating an ROIC of 8.7%.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:574px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft90">The key problems with the privatisation has been:</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:602px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft94">The lack of any economic regulation of charges since 2002. &#160;This means there is little incentive for efficiency<br/>improvements and certainly no incentive to share any cost efficiencies with customers in lower charges;<br/>The same issues as with SYD about the impact on customer charges of asset revaluation and the application of<br/>a dual till system.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:723px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft92">EZEIZA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (EZE), ARGENTINA</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:755px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft94">Privatisation of EZE has been a very bad deal for customers. &#160;The structure of the lease sale has meant very high<br/>charges, under-investment and poor customer service quality;<br/>The absence of an independent economic regulator and the clear conflict of interest as apparent from extreme-<br/>ly high royalty fees has lead to a very confrontational relationship between Government, airport operator and cus-<br/>tomer.&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:876px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft94">The sale of long-term leases on 32 of the largest airports in Argentina, included Ezeiza International Airport which<br/>was privatised in 1999. &#160;The total sale was the large single tranche of airport privatisation in the world to date. &#160;The<br/>buyers of the 30-year lease to develop and operate EZE were an international consortium of investors and airport<br/>operators, AA2000. &#160;AA2000 have been in court suing the Government for breach of contract from the start of their<br/>lease or concession. &#160;This demonstrates that these privatisation arrangements have not been satisfactory for the<br/>Government or concessionaire, let alone customer.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:993px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft94">There is no independent economic regulation to restrict the market power of the airport operator, who is running a<br/>natural monopoly. &#160;In addition the Government is imposing very high royalties for the lease, which adds very signifi-<br/>cantly to the cost base. &#160;In fact, because of its legal dispute the airport operator had only paid one-third of the lease<br/>royalties by mid-2003. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1073px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft94">Moreover, quality of service has suffered since only 10% of planned investment has been undertaken and has<br/>focused on developing commercial and not aeronautical services. &#160;The end result for airlines and passengers has<br/>been poor service quality and rising charges. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1136px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft91">The confrontational relationship between airline customers and airport operator ended up in the courts.</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:203px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft100">JORGE CHAVEZ INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (LIM), PERU</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:235px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft104">In the case of LIM royalty fees are even higher at 46% of total revenues. &#160;This, and the absence of independent<br/>economic regulation, has meant the airport operator is constantly attempting to introduce new and higher<br/>charges.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:316px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft104">The 30-year lease or concession for developing and operating LIM was sold in 2001 to a consortium of internation-<br/>al investors, Lima Airport Partners including UK-based Alterra Partners. &#160;The cost in royalty payments to the<br/>Government is 46% of total revenues, even higher than the case of SJO in Costa Rica, and the airport operators have<br/>committed to an ambitious investment programme to build LIM as a Pacific Rim hub for South America. &#160;However,<br/>political instability and the lack of long-term civil aviation policies has led to great uncertainty about these plans and<br/>dissatisfaction among airline customers.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:432px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft104">There is no independent economic regulation of charges and service quality. &#160;As a result of this and the high royal-<br/>ty charges the airport is exploiting its monopoly position, raising charging levels and adding new charges. &#160;For exam-<br/>ple LIM have proposed a tax on transfer passengers and a charge for baggage scanning. &#160;Charges for fuelling and<br/>boarding bridges are among the highest in the region. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:513px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft104">The same list of problems with the way in which EZE and SJO were privatised and the lack of economic regulation<br/>once privatised apply to LIM.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:600px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft100">ATHENS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (AIA), GREECE</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:632px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft104">Service quality at AIA is good but that comes at a very high price for its customers, in the 3rd highest charges in<br/>the world. &#160;Moreover, the regulated target rate of return of 15% ensures monopoly profits are achieved at the<br/>expense of its captive customer base.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:713px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft104">The construction in 2001 of a new international airport for Greece was set up as a 55% Government-owned priva-<br/>tised entity, with a 30-year lease for building and operating sold to a Hochtief-led consortium that included the<br/>European Investment Bank. &#160;Germany's airport investor and operator Hochtief is setting up an airport investment fund<br/>to take stakes in and operate airports around the world, to rival the Macquarie Bank Airport Fund. &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:793px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft104">There is no independent economic regulator nor any direct incentive-based price caps. &#160;Instead there is a form of<br/>'rate-of-return' regulation that caps profits at a 15% rate of return on equity. &#160;However, not only does this fail to exert<br/>the sort of efficiency incentives that a CPI-X based price cap would, but the airport is permitted to recoup any past<br/>shortfalls in achieving this rate of return. &#160;Since the weighted-average cost of capital for airports is in the region of<br/>6-7% the economic regulation guarantees monopoly profits will be made by the airport. &#160;Economic regulation should<br/>be maximizing the public interest by ensuring the monopoly supplier can earn its cost of capital but no more, as in a<br/>competitive market. &#160;The airport was built to very high standards in order to host the 2004 Olympic Games, so serv-<br/>ice quality is very good but it is extremely expensive. &#160;Charges increased by 500% over the old Athens airport.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:946px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft104">Athens was the 3rd most expensive airport in the world in 2004 according to the TRL Airport Charges Index. &#160;AIA<br/>made an operating margins in 2002 of 33.9% generating a pre-tax ROIC of 4.7%.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1016px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft102">The key problems with this privatisation were:</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1045px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft104">The was little transparency and no consultation with airline customers in the plans to built the new airport. &#160;This<br/>led to costly and inefficient investment;<br/>The 'rate-of-return' economic regulation creates no incentives for improving efficiency, and indeed permits<br/>monopoly profits. &#160;Moreover, if monopoly profits are not made in one year the regulator allows charges to be<br/>raised in order to recoup shortfalls;<br/>The use of a dual till means that aeronautical charges bear the full cost of providing aircraft and passenger serv-<br/>ices. &#160;Yet many of these are common costs necessary for the airport to provide commercial services.</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:203px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft112">THE COST OF CAPITAL HAS PROVED TOO HIGH UNDER THE 'PLC' PRIVATISATION MODEL</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:235px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft1110">Market experience has been that infrastructure providers floated under the 'plc' model have not been transpar-<br/>ent enough to allow stock market investors to see the nature of the underlying business model. &#160;As a result pri-<br/>vatised companies (e.g. in the UK, Welsh Water, BT, Transco - which runs the pipes transporting gas but does<br/>not sell gas nor explore for new reserves unlike British Gas in the public sector) have since found cheaper<br/>finance by ring-fencing the infrastructure business and funding it with debt. &#160;This amounts to a rejection by stock<br/>markets of the 'plc' model of privatisation;<br/>Generally infrastructure businesses provide a very reliable, but slow growing, revenue stream. &#160;In bull phases of<br/>stock markets, equity investors demand fast growing revenues. &#160;This encouraged a damaging trend of diversifi-<br/>cation by many privatised infrastructure providers. &#160;Vivendi, originally a successful French water utility became an<br/>international media business. &#160;Enron was originally a Texan energy utility;<br/>These stock market pressures have in most cases led to diversification into business that are not profitable nor<br/>useful to the customers of the infrastructure provider. &#160;Without strong, effective, economic regulation they will<br/>lead to excessive price increases for customers.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:504px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft112">EFFICIENCY GAINS MAXIMIZED WHERE MANAGEMENT OF BUSINESS OUTSOURCED</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:537px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft1110">The widespread experience of privatisation has been the unexpectedly large labour productivity gains, with much<br/>more efficient work practices. &#160;Since 1980 in the UK, with little fall in output, employment has been reduced by<br/>75% in steel, two-thirds in railways, half in electricity and by almost half in water;<br/>It is not ridiculous for the public sector to offer jobs to people who would otherwise be unemployed. &#160;But it proved<br/>impossible to do without undermining effective management, and created organizations where the interests of<br/>employees were put ahead of the interest of customers of the service;<br/>The most efficient utilities have not been big employers, but have outsourced as much as possible of the running<br/>of their assets to specialist, private-sector companies, with specialist capability in the management of different<br/>aspects of an infrastructure business. &#160;This introduced competition in the management of infrastructure, if not in<br/>its provision, and also sourced a pool of specialist talent. &#160;Franchises need to be short enough though to allow<br/>poor performers to be replaced. &#160;There seems little reason why this could not be the case with infrastructure<br/>providers to airlines, and indeed this has started to happen with the growth of specialist airport operators.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:788px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft112">THE SALE OF PUBLIC ASSETS AND THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPETITION MAY CONFLICT</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:820px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft1110">In the UK the sale of British Telecom slowed the introduction of competition into the telecoms markets, by turn-<br/>ing a public service into a powerful private monopoly able to resist new entrants;<br/>The deal struck to pave the way for the privatisation of British Gas, which ensured that no restructuring of the<br/>company took place. &#160;Liberalisation of gas markets, through the break-up of the company, only came about after<br/>a long battle with the regulator;<br/>The point is that not private owner, but the introduction of competition (or economic regulation) is what drives<br/>efficiency and better customer service.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:981px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft112">PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT CAN OCCUR WITHOUT THE SALE OF ASSETS TO THE PRIVATE</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1000px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft112">SECTOR</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1033px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft1110">Under the UK Conservative Government there were substantial commercial successes, while still in the public<br/>sector, for British Steel, British Airways and British Leyland;<br/>The transforming factor was that management were faced with a hard budget constraint i.e. the knowledge that<br/>the government is willing to let the business fail. They were also given autonomy i.e. considerable managerial<br/>freedom;<br/>It may be more difficult making managers of government-owned airports and air navigation providers believe that<br/>the government would let them fail. Moreover, they operate in markets far from the degree of competitive pres-<br/>sure found in steel, airlines or autos.</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:497px;left:300px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft1113">The experience of privatising infrastructure<br/>providers over the past 23 years has<br/>offered some important lessons for the<br/>future privatisation of infrastructure<br/>providers to the airline industry.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:823px;left:128px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft1110">The cost of capital has proved too high under the<br/>public limited company 'plc' privatisation model;<br/>Efficiency gains have been maximized where the<br/>management of business is outsourced;<br/>The sale of public assets and the introduction of<br/>competition may conflict;<br/>Performance improvement can occur without the<br/>sale of assets to the private sector;<br/>Governance arrangements, not ownership, are the<br/>key to success;<br/>Under the 'plc' model there is more incentive for<br/>the regulated company to present the regulator<br/>with inflated investment plans and other strategies<br/>to create the scope for unexpectedly large profits<br/>or to reduce the pressure for efficiency gains;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:823px;left:493px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft1110">There has often been a failure to balance objec-<br/>tives to provide a cheap, good quality, safe service;<br/>Without legitimacy in the eyes of customers and<br/>the public privatisation will not work;<br/>The 'plc' model is also inadequate when an infra-<br/>structure provider fails;<br/>Customers have gained from some privatisations,<br/>in terms of lower prices relative to the general con-<br/>sumer price index, but not by a lot;<br/>Shareholders of privatised companies do not<br/>always win. &#160;After an initial rise following favourable<br/>conditions under which privatisation took place,<br/>share prices have generally underperformed as<br/>previously public sector entities have not per-<br/>formed well in the private sector.</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:236px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft123">In the UK Railtrack, the rail infrastructure provider, was destroyed by the lack of any such accountability, follow-<br/>ing a major accident and a loss of public confidence. There is more public reaction when the provider deals<br/>directly with the public, as with Railtrack. The same happened earlier with Yorkshire Water, when insufficient<br/>investment left customers without water supplies. However, the unwinding of the original privatisation arrange-<br/>ments for UK NATS shows how a lack of legitimacy can undermine a company nevertheless;<br/>Competition will always be lacking for airports and ANSPs so it is vital that a political process is put in place that<br/>gives the provider legitimacy in the eyes of their customers i.e. the airlines. The public limited company 'plc' model<br/>fails in this respect. &#160;The new private company model, limited by guarantee, accountable to a board of customers<br/>and business partners, does not.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:424px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft121">THE 'PLC' MODEL IS ALSO INADEQUATE WHEN AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDER FAILS</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:456px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft123">What happens when an infrastructure provider fails? &#160;Priority should be given to better management of the serv-<br/>ice and not the realization of assets for the benefit of creditors and shareholders. The administration process of<br/>the 'plc' model was designed for private companies operating in competitive markets, not for public services;<br/>As a result the experience of failures like Railtrack in the UK has been of long delay before good service is<br/>resumed, as the 'plc' model of governance requires that the interests of creditors and shareholders are put ahead<br/>of customers;<br/>Because of the network nature of the airline business, operational problems following financial failure of an infra-<br/>structure provider would be extremely disruptive. &#160;Again the new private company model is to be preferred to the<br/>'plc' model.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:649px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft121">CUSTOMERS HAVE GAINED FROM SOME PRIVATISATIONS, BUT NOT BY A LOT</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:681px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft123">An index of the prices of 'privatised' goods and services in the UK shows that, since 1980, these prices have<br/>moved broadly in line with the prices of other goods. &#160;This is better than a rise but the efficiency gains had prom-<br/>ised a fall in prices, in real terms, for customers;<br/>There were massive reductions in labour costs through the elimination of overmanning. &#160;However, the impact of<br/>technology costs varied between industries. &#160;In telecoms falling technology costs reduced prices in real terms.<br/>In water rising costs from EU environmental regulations caused a rise in the price of water for customers. &#160;The<br/>impact of economic regulation has also varied in its effectiveness between industries;<br/>The bottom line is that considerable effort is required to ensure that privatisation of infrastructure providers is<br/>designed in such away that customers will benefit.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:874px;left:979px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft121">SHAREHOLDERS OF PRIVATISED COMPANIES DO NOT ALWAYS WIN</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:906px;left:1005px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft123">In the UK today there are 23 quoted companies that were once publicly owned. &#160;Most have outperformed stock<br/>market indices since their floatation. However, if you distinguish the period immediately after floatation with the<br/>longer run experience there is a startling divide in performance. Except Enterprise Oil (because of the price of<br/>oil) all 23 showed strong share price increases in the first two years following privatisation, but a decline there-<br/>after. On average there was a 43% rise in share price in the first two years, followed by a 39% decline there-<br/>after (as of 2002 when the study by John Kay was undertaken);<br/>This experience was partly because companies tended to be fattened for privatisation and then initially given low<br/>targets by the economic regulator, so that profits turned out better than expected. &#160;Once successfully floated the<br/>regulator tightened the screws in the interests of customers at the next regulatory review. &#160;But there has also<br/>been a fundamental problem in that these business grew up in the public sector and were poorly equipped to<br/>operate in an equity-funded private sector environment. &#160;As a result, we argue above that stock market investors<br/>have effectively rejected the 'plc' model of privatisation.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:203px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft121">GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS, NOT OWNERSHIP, ARE THE KEY TO SUCCESS</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:235px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft123">One of the key lessons has been the need to align the interests of infrastructure managers to their customers.<br/>In the public sector managers want to build and invest, to provide ample margins for security and protect them-<br/>selves from mistakes. &#160;Under the 'plc' model of privatisation managers want to please investors, boost their share<br/>options and pay for diversifications. &#160;The experience of the California electricity industry following privatisation<br/>and weak economic regulation, with 'artificial' shortages forcing up wholesale prices to the benefit of insiders,<br/>was revealed following the failure of Enron. &#160;Neither of these governance arrangements are in the interests of<br/>cost effectiveness and customer service;<br/>As a result of the failure of the 'plc' privatisation model, a number of privatised infrastructure providers have<br/>reconstituted themselves with a new governance structure that puts the interests of customers first. &#160;In the UK<br/>both Railtrack, now Network Rail, and Welsh Water or Glas Cymru, are not-for-profit companies limited by guar-<br/>antee. &#160;They are debt financed. &#160;They have no shareholders or dividend payments so any financial surpluses are<br/>invested back in the infrastructure business. &#160;Management is accountable to a board representative of customers<br/>and business partners. &#160;Constitutionally the activities of the business are limited to the provision of the infrastruc-<br/>ture, and therefore the interests of its customers. &#160;NAV CANADA has a very similar governance structure.<br/>However, so has Toronto Airport and this structure has not prevented the 'gold-plating' of terminal investments.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:532px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft121">UNDER THE 'PLC' MODEL THERE IS MORE INCENTIVE FOR 'REGULATORY GAMING'&#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:564px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft123">The pressures of achieving better than expected profits, to please the stock markets, led regulatory reviews in a<br/>number of privatised infrastructure industries to turn into a game. &#160;Companies provided inflated investment plans<br/>on the expectation that these would be knocked back by the regulators. &#160;In some instances too close a relation-<br/>ship led to 'regulatory capture' by the company allowing favourable price reviews. &#160;One solution to this is to have<br/>independent oversight by a body like the Competition Commission in the UK and the Commerce Commission in<br/>New Zealand;<br/>Clearly tough and effective economic regulation is essential for infrastructure provision in any industry, and in the<br/>air transport infrastructure in particular where competitive pressures are weak. &#160;But because of the tendency<br/>towards gaming it is not enough. &#160;Management incentives need to be aligned to those of customers. &#160;The new<br/>private company model will do this. &#160;However, it will not eliminate the tendency for 'gold-plating' of new invest-<br/>ment. &#160;The combination of strong economic regulation and the accountability of the provider to the customer is<br/>required to achieve this.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:807px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft121">FAILURE TO BALANCE OBJECTIVES TO PROVIDE A CHEAP, GOOD QUALITY, SAFE SERVICE</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:839px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft123">The principle failure of infrastructure providers in the public sector has been to provide a cost-efficient, cheap<br/>service for customers. &#160;However, the service they supply also needs to be safe and of good quality. &#160;There have<br/>been failures on both sides for some privatised infrastructure providers;<br/>The examples of serious accidents in the case of Railtrack and failure of water supply with Yorkshire Water have<br/>already been discussed. &#160;The other obvious example of a failure to supply a service of sufficient quality has been<br/>in the electricity supply industry. &#160;In 1999 Auckland in New Zealand spent seven weeks without full power. &#160;In<br/>2000 there were repeated power cuts in California, as discussed above. &#160;Later there were significant power loss-<br/>es in London, Copenhagen and across Italy. &#160;The 'plc' governance model under which these businesses operat-<br/>ed put too much pressure on managers to generate profit, to the extent that adequate capacity suffered. &#160;There<br/>is a balance to be achieved by management, which requires the right, customer-oriented, incentive structure to<br/>be put in place.</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1063px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft121">WITHOUT LEGITIMACY IN THE EYES OF CUSTOMERS AND THE PUBLIC, PRIVATISATION WILL NOT</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1083px;left:87px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft121">WORK</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:1115px;left:112px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft123">Without legitimacy in the eyes of customers and the public an infrastructure provider will be undermined. &#160;An<br/>infrastructure provider derives legitimacy or authority either from commercial success in a competitive market-<br/>place or through accountability to a political process;</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:113px;left:1187px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft132">Conclusions</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:297px;left:1037px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft136">Successful airport privatisations engage customers as key stakeholders from the outset in establishing the<br/>master plans, financial plans and the economic regulation process and then involve them in an ongoing and<br/>regular basis through agreed processes and full transparency;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:372px;left:1037px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft136">More efficient management is the key to successful privatisation, since cost of capital is almost always high-<br/>er in the private sector;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:430px;left:1037px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft136">Good governance is more important than transferring ownership to the private sector, in order for privatisa-<br/>tion to be in the public interest. &#160;However, privatisation through lease sales will be detrimental to the public<br/>interest if royalties to the Government are excessive;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:505px;left:1037px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft136">Independent, robust, economic regulation will always be necessary to create incentives, for efficiency<br/>improvements and for sharing these gains with customers, in the private monopolies created by privatisa-<br/>tion. &#160;If the Government retains a shareholding and controls the economic regulator, there is automatically<br/>an unacceptable conflict of interest;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:598px;left:1037px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft136">The most successful economic regulation has been where the regulator is also overseen by an independ-<br/>ent Competition Commission to prevent too comfortable a relationship between the regulator and the reg-<br/>ulated entity;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:673px;left:1037px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft136">Economic regulators have sometimes been good at extracting maximum value from existing assets, but<br/>have not been good at ensuring cost-effectiveness from new investment;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:731px;left:1037px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft136">Mechanisms to incentivise cost efficiency and continuous improvements must be built in from the outset.<br/>CPI-X price cap regulation will create the incentives for efficiency improvement, whereas direct or rate-of-<br/>return regulation risks preserving monopoly profits and inefficiencies in the early stages of a privatised air-<br/>port; &#160;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:824px;left:1037px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft136">In order to ensure good quality as well as cost-effective service, it is essential to have in place service level<br/>agreements (or similar systems) to ensure that service quality standards are maintained and improved;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:881px;left:1037px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft136">Controls must be put in place to prevent unjustified asset revaluations and moves to dual-till accounting<br/>which leave costs common to both aeronautical and commercial services burdening airlines and their pas-<br/>sengers with substantial charge increases;</p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:956px;left:1037px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft136">A new model, for structuring infrastructure providers in the private sector, is emerging, which could in the-<br/>ory better serve customers; a debt-financed private company structure limited by guarantee, accountable to<br/>a board of customers and business partners. &#160;In practice this still may not prevent 'gold-plating' on invest-<br/>ment programmes. &#160;Customer involvement remains essential.</p>
